# Simulation Example

Example taken from "Sistems Simulation - Shannon", pages 13 and 14.

## Use it

```sh

node index.js

```

## Notes

- You could create new data however you want and use it as we are currently using data.js, just follow the same data structure
- This is a very, very simple queue simulation model
